# Creating Problem Admin Service


--------------------------------------

## How routing is working in the pproject

- /api/v1/problems/ping
    - because the route starts with /api
        /api        -> /v1      -> /problem     -> /ping
        apiRouter   -> v1Router -> problemRouter -> problemController -> service layer
